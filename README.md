# C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, and Game Development

> "Knowing C++ will make it easier when you learn other programming languages," is what my first coding professor said to me at community college. He also mentioned how much C++ has inspired newer programming languages such as Java and C#. I agree with his statement; however, I was curious if C++ was inspired by anything when Bjarne Stroustrup created it in 1979. Thus, my conversation with ChatGPT began.

# Relevant Topics:
1. The history of C++
2. How did it become a foundational programming language
3. Why is C++ commonly used in game development
4. Who coined C++ to be relevant in games

# My Conversation With Chat Cut Up By Each Major Topic
Chat explained to me that, *"The creator of C++ did not directly derive other languages when developing C++. Instead, C++ was built as an extension of the C language,"* which is quite self-explanatory. Surprisingly, I have never looked into the C language all that much but have explored its extensions. I learned that C++ incorporates concepts from other languages such as Simula's classes and objects, as well as ALGOL's structure in programming. With this new knowledge, I wanted to dive deeper into my own personal use of C++.

As someone studying game development and aiming for a career in that field, I’ve noticed that C++ is widely used in major game engines. I wondered, *is C++ a very efficient language that allows for better performance?* Chat replied that C++ offers low-level memory access, speed, efficiency, resource management, and performance optimization. This made a lot of sense—C++ allows you to fine-tune a computer's hardware and memory. This sparked curiosity about influential researchers who have made significant contributions to game development with C++.

John Carmack is one of the first developers to create groundbreaking games using C++. His use of C++ in developing the id Tech engines set new standards for performance and real-time rendering in games. His work helped push the boundaries of 3D game development and influenced how C++ is used in high-performance game engines. As you may have noticed, I have taken the assignment of "conversing with an LLM" quite literally. It is one-sided, but still a conversation.

In my linear algebra course, it was mentioned that you could access scholarly research papers and articles. *I wanted to test this out by asking ChatGPT to provide articles, research, and books on C++.* The response was a bit disappointing; I realized that you need to use a specific GPT model to get the results I was looking for. Instead, I got a list of books and vague article titles to type into a search engine. The only link provided was to a list of top C and C++ programming books: [Top C/C++ Programming Books](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/list-top-c-c-books-programming-enthusiasts/).

I got more specific in my questioning: "Would you be able to send me scholarly research links and article links related to what we discussed about C++?" A standout article ChatGPT recommended was a study evaluating which programming languages are suitable for teaching and practical use. Their scoring showed that C++ is a great foundational language, as many in-demand industry languages were influenced by it. [Research on Programming Languages for Teaching and Practical Use](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088941#s5).

The other articles and books focused more on why C++ is widely used and how it became so prevalent. To round out my conversation, I asked Chat for any interviews related to C++ in game development and how it became the industry standard. While interviews on this topic are rare, Chat provided this article on why C++ is the industry standard for game development: [Why Are Most Games Coded in C++?](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/insights/why-are-most-games-coded-in-c).

# Conclusion
Overall, this conversation was very interesting. I learned quite a bit and got a better understanding of C++. I will most likely try and find Stroustrup's book at my local library to look through it. I will say that I was a little disapointed by the research part of my conversation with Chat. I was expecting more concrete research papers and journals. However, once I got more specific and repeated myself, then I got what I was searching for (kind of).
